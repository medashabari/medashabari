# Hi there, I'm M Shabarish! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate computer science and engineering graduate with a strong interest in full-stack data science. I enjoy exploring and implementing cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems and make a positive impact.

## About Me
- ðŸ”­ I recently completed my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm honing my skills in Full Stack Data Science at iNeuron.
- ðŸŒŸ I'm a fast learner and always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks.
- ðŸš€ My main expertise lies in Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, SQL, and C.
- ðŸ’¡ I have a strong background in leadership and enjoy taking initiative to drive projects forward.

## Projects
Here are a few notable projects I've worked on:

### Back Order Prediction 
 - Internship project at iNeuron, where I developed a predictive model to forecast backorders for inventory management. This project involved extensive data analysis, machine learning, and deployment.
### APS-Sensor Fault Detection 
- As part of my intrest, I worked on a project focused on detecting sensor faults in an APS truck system. I leveraged Python and machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies in the sensor data and develop a fault detection mechanism.


## Skills
- Programming: Python, C
- Data Science: Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization
- Databases: SQL
- Tools and Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Flask
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
